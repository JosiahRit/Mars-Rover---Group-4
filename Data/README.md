## Data

In this folder, you can check altitude, temperature and air pressure data from sensors on the Rover.

For altitude, data was acquired from GPS and BARO. For temperature we got data from IMU and BARO. For air pressure, we only have data from BARO.
You can check real world weather data from "real weather data.png".

You can also check waypoint design from the "start time.png" and "stop time.png". Total test time is 17:18. We designed a route through a 16-point grid as shown below.
The distance between each dot is 10 meters, which means the large square is 30 meters by 30 meters. The red dots are our way points.

For errors (distance) from the designed path, you can check the "xtrack.png". The maximun error is 1.44m and the mean of error is 0.23m (see "xtrackmean.png")
